# This is a program to make a dashboard as a Homescreen.
# This will be a dashboard where it shows Stocks / Spotify / Weather / To Do list / Meetings ( Calendar) / E-mails
# all in once place. This proejct will most likely be a bigger one so I will put it in smaller projects and combine them
# afterwards.
## Overall arching Step structure:
#   Step1: Figure out what Services I want to use.
#   Step2: Figure out how to interact with those services (API / CSV...)
#   Step3: Go Step by step through the programs and figure out how to pull the information out of each one.
#   Step4: Figure out a layout to display it.

# Step1:
#       Spotify (via API, probably just displaying but maybe interaction?)
#       Gmail / Zohoo
#       Open source weather app (API compatible)
#       CVS Stocks (always show yesterday or figure a way out how to update it automatically (maybe screen grabber?)
#       Figure out how you can interact with notion.so / otherwise do a to do list in txt file / print.
#       Calendar app / preferably notion.so but could also be something else

# Step2:
#       Spotfiy:
#       Questions:
#       Figure out if interaction is possible or if it's too hard for now.
#       If too hard --> just display current song / maybe leave room for the small display thingy.
#       Interacting with API or go via Webbrowser app?
